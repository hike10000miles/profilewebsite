# ProfileWebsite

This is the first website I made, the tool I used other than the standard HTML and CSS are Sass, jQuery, Bourbon, Neat, Grunt and Yeoman.

The design is simple, I just want to make a profile website for myself but used as much as I learnt as possible. I used existing Yeoman generator; Neat's grid system to help me design; also jQuery to add in some usability. This site was made to be responsive, feel free to look at it on your phone.

The problem with this project is the loading time, the picture is very big and takes time to load.
