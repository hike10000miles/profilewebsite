# ProfileWebsite

This is the first website I made, the tool I used other than the standard HTML and CSS are Sass, jQuery, Bourbon, Bower, Grunt and Yeoman.
The design is simple, I just want to make a profile website for myself but used as much as I learnt as possible. I used existing Yeoman generator and Bower to manage all the tools; Bourbon Neat's grid system to help me design; also jQuery to add in some usability. This site was made to be responsive, feel free to look at it on your phone.
